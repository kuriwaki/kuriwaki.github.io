## Advice for Writing, Coding, and Doing Research

Advice on how to do research abounds on the internet. Here I've collected here the selection of advice from other researchers that I send to my students the most. I also try to follow this advice myself as well. I hope you find them helpful and entertaining.


#### Designing Slides

Giving a 10-20 minute talk? Huber's guide is a great template that always works. Dumont's talk has the same message, but involves making charts and graphics for slides

* Greg Huber, [How to present your work at conferences: A lesson as an example](https://huber.research.yale.edu/materials/HowToPresentAtConferences.pdf), (7 slides)
* Jean-Luc Dumont, [Creating Effective Slides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meBXuTIPJQk&ab_channel=CTLStanford), (1hr talk)


#### How to Organize Files and Write Code

The Gentzkow and Shapiro manual is written with fun anecdotes and should be read cover to cover.

* Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro, [Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitionerâ€™s Guide](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf), (short manual)


#### Writing a Research Paper

Read King's article for some practical steps on starting your own research project from scratch. Read Fiske's note for concrete do's and dont's for writing sentences and wordsmithing. Watch McEnerney's talk to get back to the big picture: what makes good research good in the first place?

* Gary King, [Replication, Replication](https://gking.harvard.edu/files/replication.pdf), 9 pages
* Susan Fiske, [Words to the Wise on Writing Scientific Papers]( https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/n32qw), (4 pages)
* Larry McEnerney, [The Craft of Writing Effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM), (1h20min talk)


#### Making Good Visualizations

There are lots of resources on how to do good dataviz, but Rauser's talk has been the most eye-opening, and Wilke's webbook is the most comprehensive with beautiful illustrations.

* John Rauser, [How Humans See Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSgEeI2Xpdc&t=351s&ab_channel=JohnRauser), (40min talk)
* Claus Wilke, [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/), (full web book)
