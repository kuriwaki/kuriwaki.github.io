    <p>My research focuses on democratic representation in American Politics. In an ongoing project, I am studying the structure of voter's choices across levels of government and the political economy of local elections, both through the use of cast
      vote records. My other interests include public opinion, survey methods, and applied statistics more generally. Prior to and during graduate school, I worked at the Analyst Institute in Washington D.C.</p>

      <h3>Cast Vote Records</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      The cast vote records project is collecting and organizing public ballot image logs to advance the understanding of voting patterns in federal, state and local elections. One of the project's goals is to establish a relational database for such
      data. This project is one of the 2018 <a href="http://electionlab.mit.edu/node/75">New Initiative Grants</a> from the MIT Election Data and Science Lab. Please feel free to contact me for any questions about this project. Fore more information,
      see the associated <a href="https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bvgz3">empirical paper</a> of this ongoing work, and a <a href="papers/kuriwaki_cvr-supp.pdf">memo</a> on the administration of cast vote records.

      <h3>Teaching</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
      At Harvard I have taught classes on American Politics, statistics, and programming, at the undergraduate, Masters, and Ph.D. level. During 2019-2020, I will be shepherding the use of the R statistical language in the MPA-ID program in the
      Harvard Kennedy School as the R teaching fellow. This work included creating portable <a href="screencasts">screencasts of R workflows</a>, covering common topics in econometrics, causal inference, data science, quantitative social science.
    </p>


    <p>
      Additionally: I taught the Government <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/prefresher">Math Prefresher</a> for incoming Ph.D. students in 2017 (with Connor Jerzak) and 2018 (with Yon Soo Park). I've presented on teaching <a
        href="https://vimeo.com/channels/1591675">project-oriented workflow</a> (invited presentation, Toronto Data Workshop), introduction to <a href="programming/kuriwaki_github_handout.pdf">version control with GitHub</a> (<a

        variables, so that researchers can analyze all years of the CCES or merge in standardized variables with their own CCES datasets.</li>

        <b>About the banner image:</b> Survey data from the <a href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/II2DB6">Cumulative CCES</a>, limited to validated voters in contested districts who voted for a major party in the Presidency and House. Estimates are
        made at the congressional district level and use Multilevel Regression Poststratification (<a href="https://www.shirokuriwaki.com/ccesMRPprep/">MRP</a>) stratifying on age, gender, education from the ACS and using House candidate incumbency
        status and presidential voteshare as district-level predictors. In presidential years the values represent ticket splitting (e.g. Trump voters who voted for a 2016 Democratic House candidate); in midterm years they represent party switch from
        the previous presidential election (e.g. Trump voters who voted for a 2018 Democratic House candidate). Districts where a Democrat and Republican candidate did not contest the general election are left blank. <i>Figure created by Shiro
