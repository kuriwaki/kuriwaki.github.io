                <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                The aspiration of representative democracy is that the legislature will make 
                decisions that reflect what the majority of people want. The U.S. Constitution, 
                however, created a Congress with both majoritarian and counter-majoritarian forces. 
                We study public opinion on 103  important issues on the congressional agenda from 
                2006 to 2022 using the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. Congress made decisions 
                that aligned with what the majority wanted on 55  percent of these issues. Analysis 
                of each issue further reveals the circumstances when Congress represent the majority 
                and the many ways that representational fails. The likelihood that the House passes a 
                bill is usually a reflection of public support for that policy, but the ultimate fate 
                of bills depends on partisan control of the two chambers of Congress and the degree 
                of divisiveness (or polarization) between the two party bases in the public. Legislative 
                institutions make it difficult to pass popular issues, but even more difficult to 
                pass unpopular ones. As a result, most representational failure occurs because Congress 
                fails to pass a popular bill, rather than because Congress passes a bill that the public did not want.

                Analyzing nominally partisan contests, previous literature has argued that state and local politics have nationalized. Here we use individual ballots from the 2020 general elections covering over 43 million voters to study the relationship between individual national partisanship and voting in over 4500 down-ballot contests, including nonpartisan races and ballot measures. Voting in partisan contests can be explained by voter’s national partisanship, consistent with existing literature. However, we find that voting for local nonpartisan offices (n = 1484 contests) and ballot measures (n = 1576) is much less partisan. National partisanship explains more than 80 percent of the within-contest variation in voting for partisan state and local offices but less than 10 percent for local spending-related ballot measures. Voting for spending on roads and water are less partisan than those on education and housing, and these votes are more correlated with each other than with national partisanship.

                Do voters support dominant parties in democracies because of policy preferences or non-policy 
                (valence) factors? We consider the preeminent case of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party 
                (LDP), and investigate whether policy preferences or valence can better explain voting 
                behavior in three recent elections (2017, 2021, 2024). We first introduce a new measurement 
                strategy to infer individuals' utility for parties' policy platforms from conjoint experiments. 
                Using this measure, we find that policy preferences positively correlate with vote intentions, 
                but are not sufficient to explain LDP dominance. Many LDP voters in each election actually preferred 
                the opposition's policies. Moreover, the LDP lost support in 2024 despite proposing a more 
                popular set of policies. To understand what accounts for this disconnect, we experimentally manipulate 
                party label and decompose its effect, revealing that trust appears to be an important 
                non-policy variable behind LDP support. We interpret these findings as evidence that much of the 
                LDP’s support should be attributed to its valence advantage over the opposition, rather than voters' preferences for its policies.

                <!-- <details><summary>Abstract</summary> How well does the U.S. electoral system of states and congressional districts aggregate voters' policy preferences? A century of research has studied how districts aggregate votes for parties into legislative seats, using the well-known seats-votes curve.  This paper develops the analog for issues, called the Issue Aggregation Curve, from the spatial model. The one-dimensional model characterizes choice over specific bills; the multidimensional model characterizes choice between two alternatives that consist of bundles of issues, such as party platforms or ideologies. We estimate the issue aggregation curves for 103 issues using data from the  CCES from 2006 to 2022.  The issue aggregation curves for the U.S. Senate and House exhibit little or no bias and have steep slopes, even steeper than the seats-votes curves.  These patterns reveal that the Senate and House districts magnify, rather than interfere with, the expression of the policy preferences of the majority. </details> -->

                  <!-- The comparison of subnational areas is ubiquitous, but survey samples of these areas are often biased or prohibitively small.  Researchers turn to methods such as multilevel regression and poststratiﬁcation (MRP) to improve the efficiency of estimates by partially pooling data across areas via random effects.  However, the random effect approach can pool observations only through area-level aggregates. We instead propose a weighting estimator, the <i>synthetic area estimator</i>, which weights on variables measured only in the survey to partially pool observations <i>individually</i>. The proposed method consists of two-step weighting: first to adjust differences across areas and then to adjust for differences between the sample and population. Unlike MRP, our estimator can directly use the national weights that are often estimated from pollsters using proprietary information. Our approach also clarifies the assumptions needed for valid partial pooling, without imposing an outcome model. We apply the proposed method to estimate the support for immigration policies at the congressional district level in Florida. Our empirical results show that small area estimation models with insufficient covariates can mask opinion heterogeneities across districts.  -->

                Party loyalty in U.S. Congressional elections has reached heights unprecedented in the post-war era. Theories of partisanship as informational cues would predict that ticket splitting from national partisanship should be even more rare in low-information elections. Yet, here I show that ticket splitting in state and local offices is often higher than in Congress. I use cast vote records from voting machines that overcome ecological inference challenges, and develop a clustering algorithm to summarize such ballot data.  For example, about a third of South Carolina Trump voters form a bloc whose probability of ticket splitting is 5 percent for Congress, but 32 percent for county council and 50 percent for sheriff. I show that a model with candidate quality differentials can explain these patterns: Even in a nationalized era, some voters cross party lines to vote for the more experienced and higher quality candidate in state and local elections.

                Ballots are the basis of the electoral process. A growing group of political scientists, election administrators, and computer scientists have requested electronic records of actual ballots cast (cast vote records) from election officials, with the hope of affirming the legitimacy of elections and countering misinformation about ballot fraud. However, the administration of election data in the U.S. is scattered across local jurisdictions. Here we introduce a database of cast vote records from the 2020 U.S. general election. We downloaded, standardized, and extensively checked the accuracy of a set of cast vote records collected from the 2020 election. Our initial release includes six offices – President, Governor, U.S. Senate and House, and state upper and lower chambers – covering 40.9 million voters in 20 states who voted for a total of thousands of candidates, including 2,121 Democratic and Republican candidates. This database serves as an unparalleled source of data for studying voting behavior and election administration.

                Debates over racial voting, and over policies to combat vote dilution, turn on the extent to which groups' voting preferences differ and vary across geography. We present the first study of racial voting patterns in every congressional district in the US. Using large-sample surveys combined with aggregate demographic and election data, we find that national-level differences across racial groups explain 60 percent of the variation in district-level voting patterns, while geography explains 30 percent. Black voters consistently choose Democratic candidates across districts, while Hispanic and White voters’ preferences vary considerably across geography. Districts with the highest racial polarization are concentrated in the parts of the South and Midwest. Importantly, multi-racial coalitions have become the norm: in most congressional districts, the winning majority requires support from minority voters. In arriving at these conclusions, we make methodological innovations that improve the precision and accuracy when modeling sparse survey data.

                  Redistricting plans in legislatures determine how voters' preferences are translated into representative's seats. Political parties may manipulate the redistricting process to gain additional seats and insulate incumbents from electoral competition, a process known as <i>gerrymandering</i>.  But detecting gerrymandering is difficult without a representative set of alternative plans that comply with the same geographic and legal constraints. Harnessing recent algorithmic advances in sampling, we study such a collection of alternative redistricting plans that can serve as a non-partisan baseline. This methodological approach can distinguish electoral bias due to partisan effects from electoral bias due to other factors.  We find that Democrats are structurally and geographically disadvantaged in House elections by 8 seats, while partisan gerrymandering disadvantages them by 2 seats.

            The premise that constituents hold representatives accountable for their legislative decisions undergirds political theories of democracy and legal theories of statutory interpretation. But studies of this at the individual level are rare, examine only a handful of issues, and arrive at mixed results. We provide an extensive assessment of issue accountability at the individual level. We trace the congressional rollcall votes on 44 bills across seven Congresses (2006-2018), and link them to constituent's perceptions of their representative's votes and their evaluation of their representative.  Correlational, instrumental variables, and experimental approaches all show that constituents hold representatives accountable. A one-standard deviation increase in a constituent's perceived issue agreement with their representative can improve net approval by 35 percentage points.  Congressional districts, however, are heterogeneous. Consequently, the effect of issue agreement on vote is much smaller at the district-level, resolving an apparent discrepancy between micro and macro studies.

              How did personal wealth and slaveownership affect the likelihood Southerners fought for the Confederate Army in the American Civil War? On the one hand, wealthy Southerners had incentives to free-ride on poorer Southerners and avoid fighting; on the other hand, wealthy Southerners were disproportionately slaveowners, and thus had more at stake in the outcome of the war. We assemble a dataset on roughly 3.9 million free citizens in the Confederacy and show that slaveowners were more likely to fight than non-slaveowners. We then exploit a randomized land lottery held in 1832 in Georgia. Households of lottery winners owned more slaves in 1850 and were more likely to have sons who fought in the Confederate Army. We conclude that slaveownership, in contrast to some other kinds of wealth, compelled Southerners to fight despite free-rider incentives because it raised their stakes in the war’s outcome.

                  After an election, should election officials release a copy of each anonymous ballot? Some policymakers have championed public disclosure to counter distrust, but others worry that it might undermine ballot secrecy. We introduce the term vote revelation to refer to the linkage of a vote on an anonymous ballot to the voter's name in the public voter file, and detail how such revelation could theoretically occur. Using the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Arizona, as a case study, we show that the release of individual ballot records would lead to no revelation of any vote choice for 99.83% of voters as compared to 99.95% under Maricopa's current practice of reporting aggregate results by precinct and method of voting. Further, revelation is overwhelmingly concentrated among the few voters who cast provisional ballots or federal-only ballots. We discuss the potential benefits of transparency, compare remedies to reduce privacy violations, and highlight the privacy-transparency tradeoff inherent in all election reporting.

                  The United States Census Bureau faces a difficult trade-off between the accuracy of Census statistics and the protection of individual information. We conduct the first independent evaluation of bias and noise induced by the Bureau's two main disclosure avoidance systems: the TopDown algorithm employed for the 2020 Census and the swapping algorithm implemented for the three previous Censuses. Our evaluation leverages the Noisy Measure File (NMF) as well as two independent runs of the TopDown algorithm applied to the 2010 decennial Census. We find that the NMF contains too much noise to be directly useful, especially for Hispanic and multiracial populations. TopDown's post-processing dramatically reduces the NMF noise and produces data whose accuracy is similar to that of swapping. While the estimated errors for both TopDown and swapping algorithms are generally no greater than other sources of Census error, they can be relatively substantial for geographies with small total populations.

                  In "Differential Perspectives: Epistemic Disconnects Surrounding the US Census Bureau's Use of Differential Privacy," boyd and Sarathy argue that empirical evaluations of the Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS), including our published analysis, failed to recognize how the benchmark data against which the 2020 DAS was evaluated is never a ground truth of population counts. In this commentary, we explain why policy evaluation, which was the main goal of our analysis, is still meaningful without access to a perfect ground truth. We also point out that our evaluation leveraged features specific to the decennial Census and redistricting data, such as block-level population invariance under swapping and voter file racial identification, better approximating a comparison with the ground truth. Lastly, we show that accurate statistical predictions of individual race based on the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding, while not a violation of differential privacy, substantially increases the disclosure risk of private information the Census Bureau sought to protect. We conclude by arguing that policy makers must confront a key trade-off between data utility and privacy protection, and an epistemic disconnect alone is insufficient to explain disagreements between policy choices.

               This article introduces the 50stateSimulations, a collection of simulated congressional districting plans and underlying code developed by the Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting Methodology (ALARM) Project. The 50stateSimulations allow for the evaluation of enacted and other congressional redistricting plans in the United States. While the use of redistricting simulation algorithms has become standard in academic research and court cases, any simulation analysis requires non-trivial eforts to combine multiple data sets, identify state-specifc redistricting criteria, implement complex simulation algorithms, and summarize and visualize simulation outputs. We have developed a complete workfow that facilitates this entire process of simulation-based redistricting analysis for the congressional districts of all 50 states. The resulting 50stateSimulations include ensembles of simulated 2020 congressional redistricting plans and necessary replication data. We also provide the underlying code, which serves as a template for customized analyses. All data and code are free and publicly available. This article details the design, creation, and validation of the data.

                <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                      Surveys are a crucial tool for understanding public opinion and behaviour, and their accuracy depends on maintaining statistical representativeness of their target populations by minimizing biases from all sources. Increasing data size shrinks confidence intervals but magnifies the effect of survey bias: an instance of the Big Data Paradox. Here we demonstrate this paradox in estimates of first-dose COVID-19 vaccine uptake in US adults from 9 January to 19 May 2021 from two large surveys: Delphi–Facebook (about 250,000 responses per week) and Census Household Pulse (about 75,000 every two weeks). In May 2021, Delphi–Facebook overestimated uptake by 17 percentage points (14–20 percentage points with 5% benchmark imprecision) and Census Household Pulse by 14 (11–17 percentage points with 5% benchmark imprecision), compared to a retroactively updated benchmark the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published on 26 May 2021. Moreover, their large sample sizes led to miniscule margins of error on the incorrect estimates. By contrast, an Axios–Ipsos online panel with about 1,000 responses per week following survey research best practices provided reliable estimates and uncertainty quantification. We decompose observed error using a recent analytic framework to explain the inaccuracy in the three surveys. We then analyse the implications for vaccine hesitancy and willingness. We show how a survey of 250,000 respondents can produce an estimate of the population mean that is no more accurate than an estimate from a simple random sample of size 10. Our central message is that data quality matters more than data quantity, and that compensating the former with the latter is a mathematically provable losing proposition.

                    Census statistics play a key role in public policy decisions and social science research. Yet given the risk of revealing individual information, many statistical agencies are considering disclosure control methods based on differential privacy, which add noise to tabulated data. Unlike other applications of differential privacy, however, census statistics must be post-processed after noise injection to be usable. We study the impact of the US Census Bureau's new Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) on a major application of census statistics: the redrawing of electoral districts. We find that the DAS systematically undercounts the population in mixed-race and mixed-partisan precincts, yielding unpredictable racial and partisan biases. The DAS also leads to a likely violation of "One Person, One Vote" standard as currently interpreted, but does not prevent accurate predictions of an individual's race and ethnicity. Our findings underscore the difficulty of balancing accuracy and respondent privacy in the Census.

                We apply the concept of the data defect index (Meng, 2018) to study the potential impact of systematic errors on the 2020 pre-election polls in twelve Presidential battleground states. We investigate the impact under the hypothetical scenarios that (1) the magnitude of the underlying non-responses bias correlated with supporting Donald Trump is similar to that of the 2016 polls, (2) the pollsters' ability to correct systematic errors via weighting has not improved significantly, and (3) turnout levels remain similar as 2016. Because survey weights are crucial for our investigations but are often not released, we adopt two approximate methods under different modeling assumptions. Under these scenarios, which may be far from reality, our models shift Trump's estimated two-party voteshare by a percentage point in his favor in the median battleground state, and increases twofold the uncertainty around the voteshare estimate.

                The political science math prefresher arose a quarter-century ago and has now spread to many of our discipline’s PhD programs. Incoming students arrive for graduate school a few weeks early for ungraded instruction in math, statistics, and computer science  as  they  relate  to  political  science.  The  prefresher’s  benefits,  however,  go  beyond  its  technical content: it opens pathways to mastering methods necessary for political science research, facilitates connections among peers, and &mdash; perhaps most important &mdash; eases the transition to the increasingly collaborative nature of graduate work. The prefresher also shows how faculty across a highly diverse discipline have worked together to train the next generation. We review this program and advance its collaborative aspects by building infrastructure to share teaching content across universities so that separate programs can build on one another’s work and improve all of our programs.</details>

<h3 id="book">Book Project: <i>Representation in America</i></h3>

<p>(with Stephen Ansolabehere, under review)</p>

<p>This book, tentatively titled <i>Representation in America</i>, argues that through all of the gridlock and the polarization that has plagued the government over the past three decades, the U.S. Congress remains a largely majoritarian institution.  Building on 15 years of data on public preferences of more than 500,000 Americans, this study examines what voters know, what they care about when they vote, and how well their legislators and their Congress reflect their preferences.  Representation is not a seamless or mechanical process, but it aggregates peoples' beliefs and preferences well on the important issues that face the country.  Individual voters do not follow the details of congressional legislation but most know enough to hold correct beliefs about legislation and to hold their representatives accountable.  The electoral system is very good at aggregating what the public wants and at moderating hyper-partisan views.  And, on just over a half of important bills under our study, Congress makes decisions in line with the majority of the nation.  As a result, representation in America, when it does fail, often fails because Congress does not have support among those layers of institutions.

                 <details><summary>Course Description</summary><p>The United States Congress is arguably the most powerful legislature in the world. Its actions—and inaction—affect taxes, healthcare, business, the environment, and international politics. To understand the nature of legislative power in Congress and in democracies more broadly, we ask: How do successful politicians become powerful? How do they navigate rules and institutions to their advantage? What is the proper role of the lawmaking in regulating private business? Should we limit legislative lobbying and put a cap on campaign contributions? Class discussions use case studies including the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s, the Tax Reform Act under Reagan, and the Affordable Care Act under Obama. Exercises include coding and data analysis. The goal is to equip students with a broad understanding of the principles of politics, economics, public policy, and data science.</p>

     <b>About the banner image:</b> Survey data from the <a href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/II2DB6">Cumulative CCES</a>, limited to validated voters in contested districts who voted for a major party in the Presidency and House. Estimates are
     made at the congressional district level and use Multilevel Regression Poststratification (<a href="https://www.shirokuriwaki.com/ccesMRPprep/">MRP</a>) stratifying on age, gender, education from the ACS and using House candidate incumbency
     status and presidential voteshare as district-level predictors. In presidential years the values represent ticket splitting (e.g. Trump voters who voted for a 2016 Democratic House candidate); in midterm years they represent party switch from
     the previous presidential election (e.g. Trump voters who voted for a 2018 Democratic House candidate). Districts where a Democrat and Republican candidate did not contest the general election are left blank. <i>Figure created by Shiro
