          <summary>Abstract</summary>
          The premise that constituents hold representatives accountable for their legislative decisions undergirds political theories of democracy and legal theories of statutory interpretation. But studies of this at the individual level are rare, examine only a handful of issues, and arrive at mixed results. We provide an extensive assessment of issue accountability at the individual level. We trace the congressional rollcall votes on 44 bills across seven Congresses (2006-2018), and link them to constituent's perceptions of their representative's votes and their evaluation of their representative.  Correlational, instrumental variables, and experimental approaches all show that constituents hold representatives accountable. A one-standard deviation increase in a constituent's perceived issue agreement with their representative can improve net approval by 35 percentage points.  Congressional districts, however, are heterogeneous. Consequently, the effect of issue agreement on vote is much smaller at the district-level, resolving an apparent discrepancy between micro and macro studies.

            <p>How did personal wealth and slaveownership affect the likelihood Southerners fought for the Confederate Army in the American Civil War? On the one hand, wealthy Southerners had incentives to free-ride on poorer Southerners and avoid fighting; on the other hand, wealthy Southerners were disproportionately slaveowners, and thus had more at stake in the outcome of the war. We assemble a dataset on roughly 3.9 million free citizens in the Confederacy and show that slaveowners were more likely to fight than non-slaveowners. We then exploit a randomized land lottery held in 1832 in Georgia. Households of lottery winners owned more slaves in 1850 and were more likely to have sons who fought in the Confederate Army. We conclude that slaveownership, in contrast to some other kinds of wealth, compelled Southerners to fight despite free-rider incentives because it raised their stakes in the war’s outcome.</p>

          <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
            <p>The political science math prefresher arose a quarter-century ago and has now spread to many of our discipline’s PhD programs. Incoming students arrive for graduate school a few weeks early for ungraded instruction in math, statistics, and computer sci-ence  as  they  relate  to  political  science.  The  prefresher’s  benefits,  however,  go  beyond  its  technical content: it opens pathways to mastering methods necessary for political science research, facilitates connections among peers, and &mdash; perhaps most important &mdash; eases the transition to the increasingly collaborative nature of graduate work. The prefresher also shows how faculty across a highly diverse discipline have worked together to train the next generation. We review this program and advance its collaborative aspects by building infrastructure to share teaching content across universities so that separate programs can build on one another’s work and improve all of our programs.</p></details>

              [Earlier <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bvgz3/">version</a>, titled "Party Loyalty on the Long Ballot: Is Ticket Splitting More Prevalent in State and Local Elections?" covered by  <a href="https://perma.cc/V83G-X9US"><i>The Post and Courier</i></a>, <a href="https://perma.cc/L4AV-2SWG "><i>Governing</i>, <a href="https://perma.cc/PH22-GDS7"><i>Colorado Public Radio News</i></a>].</li>
              <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                <p>Many believe that party loyalty in U.S. elections has reached heights unprecedented in the post-war era, although this finding relies on evidence from presidential, congressional, and gubernatorial elections. If party labels are a heuristic, we would expect  party-line voting to be even more dominant in lower-information elections. Yet, here I show that the prevalence of ticket splitting in state and local offices is often similar to or higher than in national offices because of larger incumbency advantages and starker candidate valence differentials. Because neither surveys nor election returns have been able to reliably measure individual vote choice in downballot races, I introduce an underused source of voter data: cast vote records. I create a database from voting machines that reveals the vote choices of 6.6 million voters for all offices on the long ballot, and I design a clustering algorithm tailored to such ballot data. In contrast to ticket splitting rates of 5 to 7 percent in US House races, about 15 to 20 percent of voters split their ticket in a modal Sheriff race. Even in a nationalized politics, a fraction of voters still cross party lines to vote for the more experienced candidate in state and local elections.</p>

              <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                We apply the concept of the data defect index \citep{MengAOAS} to study the potential impact of systematic errors on the 2020 pre-election polls in twelve Presidential battleground states. We investigate the impact under the hypothetical scenarios that (1) the magnitude of the underlying non-responses bias correlated with supporting Donald Trump is similar to that of the 2016 polls, (2) the pollsters' ability to correct systematic errors via weighting has not improved significantly, \add{and (3) turnout levels remain similar as 2016.} Because survey weights are crucial for our investigations but are often not released, we adopt two approximate methods under different modeling assumptions.  \add{Under these scenarios, which may be far from reality, our models shift Trump's estimated two-party voteshare by a percentage point in his favor in the median battleground state, and increases twofold the uncertainty around the voteshare estimate.}

              <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                Large-scale ballot and survey data hold the potential to uncover the prevalence of swing voters and strong partisans in the electorate. However, existing approaches either employ exploratory analyses that fail to fully leverage the information available in high-dimensional data, or impose a one-dimensional spatial voting model. I derive a clustering algorithm which better captures the probabilistic way in which theories of political behavior conceptualize the swing voter. Building from the canonical finite mixture model, I tailor the model to vote data, for example by allowing uncontested races. I apply this algorithm to actual ballots in the Florida 2000 election and a multi-state survey in 2018. In Palm Beach County, I find that up to 60 percent of voters were straight ticket voters; in the 2018 survey, even higher. The remaining groups of the electorate were likely to cross the party line and split their ticket, but not monolithically: swing voters were more likely to swing for state and local candidates and popular incumbents.

              <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
              Multilevel models have long played an important role in a variety of social sciences.  We extend this framework by bringing to bear recent developments in the machine learning literature to allow for considerable flexibility.  We introduce a sparse regression framework that covers both  the  linear  case  as  well  as  a  logit  model  for  binary  outcome  data.   We  leverage  recent computational tricks based on data-augmentation to dramatically speed up estimation times with equal or better performance compared to existing approaches.  We apply our model in the context of multilevel modelling with post-stratification which has become a common tool for survey researchers.

              made at the congressional district level and use Multilevel Regression Poststratification (<a href="https://www.shirokuriwaki.com/ccesMRPprep/">MRP</a>) stratifying on age, gender, education from the ACS and using House candidate incumbency
              status and presidential voteshare as district-level predictors. In presidential years the values represent ticket splitting (e.g. Trump voters who voted for a 2016 Democratic House candidate); in midterm years they represent party switch from
              the previous presidential election (e.g. Trump voters who voted for a 2018 Democratic House candidate). Districts where a Democrat and Republican candidate did not contest the general election are left blank. <i>Figure created by Shiro
