### Summary
Teaching fellows in the social sciences increasingly teach programming and math in social science departments.  However, traditional TF training often omits this content. Therefore TFs often reinvent the wheel and over-invest in lesson planning. This session prepares for such classes.  Happening the week before Spring classes and intended for students who have already had done the department TF training, we will focus on actionable techniques and concrete questions. We will (1) collect and synthesize common challenges in our teaching, (2) introduce best practices for designing exercises, and (3) improve each of our sections based on a case discussion.

### Who is this training for?
Our goal will be to provide immediately actionable plans for TFs.  We expect a small group discussion of about a dozen Gov students,  with most having some experience teaching programming and/or methods courses, and completing the Gov departmentâ€™s pedagogy course (Gov 3002). However, prior teaching is not a prerequisite and any Gov student interested in the content is welcome.  By participating in this training, students will gain immediately actionable tools to design a section in the Spring semester.  We will synthesize our collective experience, rather than having to reinvent the wheel.  Ideas and data collected as a part of this session will be valuable data to circulate outside the Gov department and Harvard.

### Pre-class work
To maximize the effectiveness of the time together, we ask attendees to do two things beforehand. (1) Evaluate their teaching evaluations they have received in the Fall and share a summary of the constructive parts of these evaluations. (2) Study a recording of a past section we will provide beforehand, for a case discussion we will do in the second part of the session.  Details will be sent to attendees.
